I am a M.S. student in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Tanushree Mitra](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/). My research interest are Social Computing, Algorithmic Audits, AI Ethics, Computational Social Science, and NLP.

As a graduate student, I've also conducted research with [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/) and [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/). Previously, I received undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Political Science from the University of Washington.

## research interests

My research focuses on **advancing inclusive AI technologies and online platforms** to better serve people who are overlooked in the development of these systems. Driven by my interdisciplinary background, I develop technical frameworks and methods grounded in social science theories, with two main goals:

1. **Auditing AI technologies and online platforms** for bias and misinformation to build a more responsible socio-technical future.
2. **Understanding social phenomena**, such as community norms, through language and online behavior to promote socially-attuned and equitable technologies.
