I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/), co-advised by [Manoel Horta Ribeiro](https://manoelhortaribeiro.github.io/) and [Aleksandra Korolova](https://www.korolova.com/). I design and evaluate how agentic systems retrieve, synthesize, and present scientific evidence--and audit their failures in human interaction and decision-making, especially in high-stakes domains like health and scientific contexts.

Previously, I received my M.S. at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Tanushree Mitra](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/). I was also fortunate to conduct research with [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/), [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), [Monojit Choudhury](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/monojit-choudhury/), and [Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/). Before that, I received undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Political Science from the University of Washington.
