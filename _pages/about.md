I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/), co-advised by [Manoel Horta Ribeiro](https://manoelhortaribeiro.github.io/) and [Aleksandra Korolova](https://www.korolova.com/). I am affiliated with the [Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP)](https://citp.princeton.edu/) and [Princeton Language and Intelligence (PLI)](https://pli.princeton.edu/). My research interest are Social Computing, Computational Social Science, and NLP.

Previously, I received my M.S. at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Tanushree Mitra](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/). I was also fortunate to conduct research with [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/), [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), [Monojit Choudhury](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/monojit-choudhury/), and [Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/). Before that, I received undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Political Science from the University of Washington.

## research interests

My research focuses on **advancing inclusive AI technologies and online platforms** to better serve people who are overlooked in the development of these systems. Driven by my interdisciplinary background, I develop technical frameworks and methods grounded in social science theories, with two main goals:

1. **Auditing AI technologies and online platforms** for bias and misinformation to build a more responsible socio-technical future.
2. **Understanding social phenomena**, such as community norms, through language and online behavior to promote socially-attuned and equitable technologies.
